My name is Jacob Walker. I am a Bioinformatics major, but I have really enjoyed all the CS classes I have had to take, and would like to go into software development after graduating. Your project was the one that interested me the most. I have experience with SQL, Javascript, and some web frameworks. I would be happy to join your team.
You can contact me on Slack. My email is jacobisraelw3@gmail.com.
